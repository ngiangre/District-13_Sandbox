## How to use this python script to manually generate JSON files
1. Insert the URL derived from the IOL Interface
* This needs to be done for each of the PITs that we wish to display 
  * Perhaps for demo purposes we just use Five Lakes and just display the others as a list since it isn't a live demo
2. Save the specific info assocated with Sarah along with an informative file name
* e.g. her conditions from FiveLakes should be `SarahConditions_FiveLakes`
